> This project is no longer maintained as of June 2025. The ecosystem is moving delightfully fast, with Remix and React Router at last coming together, and Vite taking huge strides. This is *awesome* and I can't wait to use all this amazing new tooling, but at this point this project has such a lack of features that the maintenence load to keep up with the ecosystem is not worth it.

> I still think this would be a cool project to make, but I do not have the time or dedication for it at present.
